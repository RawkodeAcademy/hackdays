# Rawkode Academy Hackdays

> **Work in Progress**

This document outlines the idea of asynchronous hackdays for the community of Rawkode Academy.

## Basic idea
- Everyone is invited, not just the people of Rawkode Academy
- 2-4 weeks of time
- Groups of 2 or more
  - Randomized
  - People who don't know each other
- Using a programming language or framework or technology that you haven't use before
  - Fulltime Java developer but coding an IRC server in Elixir
  - Rust enthusiast, but code a particle library in Vanilla Javascript
- OSS suitable license
  - MIT
  - WTFPL
- The result will be presented after the given time is over
  - Video on YouTube / Twitch
  - Blog post
  - README.md in the projects repository

## Implementation
- When: Starting 1st of August for 2-4 weeks
- Groups of 2 or more (preferred)
  - People can pitch their topic and people can join them
- Theme: Window of opportunity
  - You're stuck in a time loop of finding a hideous bug. Some form of software can help you find the root cause. What software might that be?
  - Some ideas:
    - Tooling for better http call tracing
    - Interactive CLI for Grafana metrics
    - ...
- Language / framwork choice should be something you haven't used before
- The result will be presented after the given time is over
  - Video on YouTube / Twitch
  - Blog post
  - README.md in the projects repository 
- The community votes for the best 3 solutions
- The winners receive a prize
